# Aveon-Social-Data-Sharing-App
This is a messenger application for android that I programmed for State Farms Mobile Application Development competition that ran from February 6th, 2020 to April 6th, 2020. that allows data sharing of all types of data form texts to pictures to location to large files with unlimited size to send. Additionally it is almost fully decentralized using edge computing in a cloud architecture. My cloud has a small private block chain network for access control.
